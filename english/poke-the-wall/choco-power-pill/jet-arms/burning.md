You point your blowtorch arms downward, and turn up the heat.

You fly into the sky! Or at least, that's what you *thought* would happen. 
Instead, the blowtorches just get longer, and more concentrated. Like a fiery "LightSaber".

In a suprised motion, you do a quick circle trying to figure out what's going on. And when you turn, so do your arms.
You make a hole in the floor and fall through, landing on some sort of a wide sloping slide. -Not unlike the slide levels from Super Mario 64-

You begin sliding down on the circle you cut out of the floor, and deactivate your arms. You look behind you, and the see chocolate begin spilling out of the hole.

Now what?
